Task: Create a Panel Custom Component Wrapping emoji-picker-element

I want to wrap the https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element web component as a reusable Panel custom component.

Goals

- Keep it simple - Focus on core functionality that demonstrates the integration works
- Bidirectional communication - Python can configure the picker, and emoji selections sync back to Python
- Testable - Include working unit tests and UI tests (Playwright)
- Demo-ready - Provide a panel serve app demonstrating responsive resizing and live interaction

Core Features to Implement

Properties (Python → JS):
- skin_tone - Default skin tone for emojis (0-5)
- locale - Language locale (e.g., "en", "de")

Events (JS → Python):
- value - The selected emoji object (or its key properties like unicode, name)

Deliverables

1. Component file - emoji_picker.py with the EmojiPicker class
2. Unit tests - test_emoji_picker.py testing parameter sync and model serialization
3. UI tests - ui/test_emoji_picker.py using Playwright to test actual selection behavior
4. Demo app for social media - An app.py that can be run with panel serve app.py --show demonstrating:
    - Responsive resizing (picker adapts to container width)
    - Selecting an emoji updates a Python-bound display
    - Changing skin tone from Python updates the picker

Please create a plan
